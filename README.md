# MyCamp

   Small project managing app using Firebase. It gathers all project members in groups, offers a chat service and a To Do list in order to keep all of them updated.

## How it works :
   The user logs in via his Google account. He is automatically directed to the main activity where he can choose wich section to open : Chat, To-Do list or Profile.
   The default group chat for a new user is : Open.  The admin -project chef- can access the firebase console in order to direct any user to his appropriate group (Dev Team, Commercial Team,.. ) 
and assign task to them. He can also change the users' phone numbers and other infos.
